            <h3 style="padding-left: 120px;">Bienvenidos! Welcome to my blog Day 1! </h3>
            <p class="blog-paragraph"> I know it says blog, but in actuality this will just be a sort of journal documenting the start of my journey of 100 days of code. As stated in the title, "and beyond" I intend to keep
                it going as I feel a software engineer never stops. Or until I find a more efficienct and better looking way to blog this. Anyways, this blog will probably get a little rambly as it
                will be me just putting my thoughts down like I am right now. A little about myself: I am a soon-to-be veteran who has finally found his passion: programming, and is trying all the tricks
                that he keeps reading about to make a good online presence and show my interest while I earn my degree.<br>
                <span class="blog-paragraph">I hope as my experience grows that this blog may turn informative and helpful for others who may be working on similar projects or technologies. I am currently working on master C# and .NET
                which I will admit that at the moment figuring out which Web App format to use (Blazor, MVC, ASP.NET/ASP.NET core) is a little confusing. Hopefully I can figure it out and lay it out in a simple
                manner that will help others.</span><br>
                <span class="blog-paragraph">As this is the first day, my coding task today was to get this set up for easy blog submissions each day. Today I will also continue work on a C# RPG I am making using WPF. I will also be completing
                day 2 of the 30 days of code hackerrank challenge. After that I will be practicing algorithms and reading data structures.</span>
